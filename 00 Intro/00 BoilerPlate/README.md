# Boiler Plate Sample

In this sample we are going to setup a web project that can be easily managed
by webpack.

We will setup an initial npm project, give support to ES6, and install webpack.

We will create a hellword.js sample.

Summary steps:
 - Intialize package.json (npm init)
 - Create a simple HTML file.


# Steps to build it

## Prerequisites

Prerequisites, you will need to have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v. 6.3.1) installed in your computer.

## steps

- Navigate to the folder where you are going to create the empty project.

- Execute npm init, you will be prompted to answer some information request
about the project (once you have successfully fullfilled them a package.json
file we will generated).

````
npm init
````

![npm init](../../99 Readme Resources/02 Webpack/Demo00_npminit.png "Demo00_npminit.png")

- We will now install locally webpack, as a development dependency (the reason to install it locally and not globaly is to be easy to setup, e.g. can be launched on a clean machine without having to install anything globally but nodejs)

````
npm install webpack --save-dev
````


- We will write es6 code but we need to transpile it to es5, in order to do
that we will install babel-core plus babe-preset-es2015 and save it as a dev dependency on the package.json that has been generated by the npm init command we have created.

````
npm install babel-core --save-dev
npm install babel-preset-es2015 --save-dev
````

- We need to install a "loader" (more on this in next modules) in order for
webpack to be able to make use of babel-core transpiler.

````
npm install babel-loader --save-dev
````

Our package.json file should look something like:

![package.json](../../99 Readme Resources/02 Webpack/Demo00_packagejson.png "Demo00_npminit.png")


- Now we are going to create a js file called students.js that will include ES6 syntax.

```
// Let's use some ES6 features
const averageScore = "90";
const messageToDisplay = `average score ${averageScore}`;

document.write(messageToDisplay);
```

- It's time to configure our webpack config, we will start by creating an empty skeleton, and indicate the js entry point.

```
module.exports = {
	entry: ["./students.js"],
	output: {
		filename: "bundle.js"
	}
}
```

- Now let's add support for es6, we will ask webpack to handle all js file that  finds in the project (excluding node_modules subfolder) and transpile them from es6 to es5 (using the babel-loader).

```
module.exports = {
	entry: ["./students.js"],
	output: {
		filename: "bundle.js"
	},

	module: {
		loaders: [
			{
				test: /\.es6$/,
				exclude: /node_modules/,
				loader: "babel-loader"
			}
		]
	}
}
```


- Let's run webpack from the command line, we can check that a file named "bundle.js" has been generated.

![npm init](../../99 Readme Resources/02 Webpack/Demo00_webpackexec.png "Demo00_webpackexec.png")

- if we open the bundle.js files we can check that it contains (amongst other boiler plate code) the transpiled to es5 version of students.js

```
/***/ function(module, exports) {

	"use strict";

	// Let's use some ES6 features
	var averageScore = "90";
	var messageToDisplay = "average score " + averageScore;

	document.write(messageToDisplay);

/***/ }
```

- Let's create a simple HTML file, and include a script tag that will point to our generated bundle.js file. Now we can click on the html file and see our small piece of code up and running.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title></title>
    <script src="bundle.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    Hello webpack !
  </body>
</html>
```
